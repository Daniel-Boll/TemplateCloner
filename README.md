First you need to have a template repository to *"fork"* from. 

Then with the gh cli you can

```bash
gh repo create -y -p {SourceRepo(User/Org)}/{SourceRepo} --(public|private) {DestinyRepo(User/Org)}/{DestinyRepo} 
```

Then all you need to do is create a sshkey pair and a github action to sync up with your repo.

But the `template-clone` cli do all of this to you.

```bash
template-cloner
? where are you cloning from # Here you informe the {SourceRepo(User/Org)}
                             # for example Daniel-Boll

? select a repo (Use arrow keys) # Then it will list all the repos from that user/org
‚ùØ TemplateCloner                 # you just have to select which one you want to clone
...                              # from
(Move up and down to reveal more choices)
 
? where youre gonna clone it (owner/repo)  # Now you provide the destination of the cloned repo
                                           # for example MyOrg/Project2
```

Then it will prompt you for specific configurations of the repo

- Create the repo as public or private
- Generate automatically the ssh keys
- Generate the yml action file

When it's complete you will have some things to do that the script current cannot.

---

### Commit changes.
Enter the just created folder and commit the file .github folder with the changes, you can also add the `sshkey` and `sshkey.pub` into .gitignore.

---

### Add secrets
Add the secrets to your repository.

- SOURCE_REPO = `From where you have cloned {User/Org}/{RepoName}`
- TARGET_BRANCH = `usually main`
- SOURCE_REPO_SSH_PRIVATE_KEY = `Here you will put the content of the *sshkey* file`

---

### Add deploy key
In the repo you are cloning from you will have to add a deploy key, it will contain the value equivalent to the `sshkey.pub` file.
